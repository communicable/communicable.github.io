I am ashamed of myself. Near as I can tell, I have always been ashamed of
myself. I also feel guilt. But, mostly, I feel shame.

I'm not a good enough. I'm too fat. I'm too lazy. I'm too dumb. I'm too mentally
ill. That's the Cliff Notes version of my internal monologue.

Brené Brown gave me a mirror when she compared shame and guilt. In her second TED Talk,
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame">Listening to Shame</a>,
she said:

> Guilt: "I'm sorry. I made a mistake."

> Shame: "I'm sorry. I am a mistake."

I am a mistake. That's exactly how I feel, even when my medication is working.
And, what's worse, is that shame has some pretty negative correlations:

> Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence,
> aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders.

I'm guilty of all of those except, thankfully, suicide. But, what do I do about
it? How can I feel differently? How can I remove shame from my life?
