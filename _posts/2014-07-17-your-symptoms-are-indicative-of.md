__Wait! What?__

How can you possibly know that? This is only my third session. You don’t know
me. You can’t possibly know that I’m crazy. What, just because my antidepressant
sent me into a productive fury?

__Damn it!__

Don’t take away my antidepressant! I felt awesome! I don’t want to feel like I
did before. Please, don’t make me quit. I’d like to feel like that all the time.

__Holy shit!__

What if I am crazy? What will people think? No one will want to have anything to
do with me. I’ll be a leper. With HIV!

__No one knows.__

Thank God, no one knows. I just won’t say anything. I can hide it. I can burry
the crazy. Besides, it’s not anyone else’s business. It only affects me.

__Well, yeah&hellip;__

I suppose my family counts. And, what few friends I have. And, maybe my
coworkers. I guess I’ve been pretty hard on all of them: missing work, raging
furiously, ignoring them&hellip;

__Alright, alright.__

I’ll take the mood stabilizer. But, can I please stay on the antidepressant? I
just don’t want to go back to where I was before.

__Sigh.__

Is that all the antidepressant I can take? That’s a quarter of what I was
taking. Okay. Well&hellip; It’s better than nothing, I suppose.
