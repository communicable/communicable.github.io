Well, the last two weeks have been hell. I was making such good progress, if not with my physical activity, at least with my diet. But, something happened and I got frustrated and started eating off plan. I even quit meal tracking, which is the kiss of death to my meal planning.

The end result? I've been bouncing around weight wise. Right now, I'm at 26 pounds lost. So, my goal for August didn't work out.

The silver lining? Well... There's a whole lot less junk in the house, now. I've eaten most of it. Also, Jill and I are talking about my relapse, which took two weeks. But, I was finally ready to own up to it, last night. So, back on the bandwagon tomorrow.

So, what are my goals for September? Well, I have this nifty Garmin fitness tracker that adjusts my step goal based on whether or not I met my previous goal. When I meet my previous goal, the new goal is higher. When I don't, it goes down. With that in mind, I think I'll lower my goals this month:

* 8 pounds
* 30+ minutes of cardio, 2+ times per week

As always, wish me luck!
