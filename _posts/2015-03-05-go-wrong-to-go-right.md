Have you ever been so frightened that your insides shook? No?

Have you ever been so cold that your insides shook? Ah!

That's what severe anxiety feels like. I should know. I spent the first half
of 2014 shaking inside.

Actually, it started in November 2013, when my boss gave me six weeks to find
a new job. Those six weeks were awful. I started looking around for work, but
could not find anything. So, I tried to negotiate a new role at my current
employer. They didn't have anything for me. I was so anxious that I could
literally feel myself shaking inside.

The axe fell the first week of January. That was hard. I was so scared that
I'd not be able to find another engineering management role. I feared my
skills were inadequate. After all, I'd just been fired, hadn't I? Who'd want me?

I spent the next several weeks in panic mode. I had no idea what to do. I sent
resumes all over the place. But, I wasn't getting any traction. I was so tied
up and twisted inside that I could never put a good foot forward, let alone my
best foot.

Eventually, the anxiety gave way to depression. I just sat around watching
television and playing games on the computer all day, completely ignoring my
predicament.

Then, finally, in April, I began writing software again. I started slowly. I
took as many online tutorials as I could. I passed all the coding tests and
was accepted at a local code school - one of the bootcamp style programs.
I declined their gracious offer, and started looking for a job as an engineer.

I found a job in the middle of June. But, even then, I would still get bouts
of anxiety. What if my new employer finds out I'm not good enough? What if I
get fired again? What will I do?

Well, here it is March 2015 and I'm still there. Not only that, I got a 10%
raise after only six months! So, I did something right!

Looking back on it now, I was working in a terrible environment. The company
had a toxic culture. I tried to stay because I was so afraid of not being able
to find work elsewhere. But, ultimately, I'm much happier at my new employer
where the culture is more supportive than competitive.

Sometimes things have to go wrong in order to go right.
