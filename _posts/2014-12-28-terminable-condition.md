I stumbled on this [quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rMoQesq05Y) recently...

> Life is a terminable condition. We're all going to die.
> But how many of us will truly live, and live for ourselves first and foremost?
> Not for your spouse, not for your parent, not for your career, not for your illness.
> Live for you.
> That's the golden ticket.

Kris Carr is a cancer survivor turned wellness activist. And, while this quote
is about her emotional journey, the part about not living for your illness
spoke to me.
