I'm saddened, but not surprised, by [the news](http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/showbiz/robin-williams-dead/index.html),
today, that Robin Williams committed suicide. I knew he had suffered from depression. And, frankly, when I first heard about his death, I immediately wondered whether it was suicide.

Depression is a bitch. It is insidious. And, it robs you of everything joyful and inspiring about life. It can even take away your willingness to live.
