My name is Alan. I am a husband, a father, a professional programmer, an amateur
photographer, and...

I have Bipolar Disorder, depression and anxiety.

So, I've got that going for me.

My intention here is to reflect upon my illness as objectively as possible â€“ to
take it out of my head and look at it as separate and distinct from me. If you
have a mental illness, you know how difficult this is.

If I happen to help you or anyone else through my writing, great! But, that's
not my goal. I'm not trying to be [Glenn Close](http://bringchange2mind.org). I
simply want to live a happier, more productive life, free of depression,
anxiety, rage, and shame.

Wish me luck!
