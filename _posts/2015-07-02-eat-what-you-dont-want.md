title: The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not.

Having gone through the 20/20 Lifestyles program in the past, I knew what I was getting into. I knew that week one was going to be tough. In fact, the quote above describes it pretty much to a tee.

In week one, the goals of the program are to a) get you moving, b) get you hydrated, and c) get all the refined carbohydrates out of your system. So, I'm following the meal plan, drinking lots of water, and I started taking walks.

In the five days since I started the program, I've taken three walks of 45 minutes each. Tomorrow, it'll be four. The day after that, it'll be five. And, so it begins. Eventually, walking won't get my heart rate up enough. Hopefully, by then, I'll have lost enough weight that my knees can take me jogging.

Water consumption is going extremely well. In the last five days, I've had somewhere around 340 ounces of water. It sounds like a lot. And, boy let me tell you, it is. I must pee half a dozen times a day now.

And, that brings me to food. The diet calls for men to eat between 1500 and 1750 calories a day. So far, I've averaged about 1570 calories a day, which is great. But - and here's where the quote comes in - I am REALLY tired of drinking protein shakes and eating grilled chicken. Thankfully, so is my wife. So, she tried making broiled tofu with a cilantro pesto sauce tonight. And... It was really good! I'd totally eat it again!

I'm so thankful she's doing this with me. It would be impossible on my own.
