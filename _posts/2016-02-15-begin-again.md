Well, here we are again.

I'm 48 years old, 6 feet tall, and 285 pounds. I am middle-aged and obese. I still have hypertension, dyslipidemia, Type II Diabetes, and severe obstructive sleep apnea - not to mention Bipolar Disorder, anxiety, and depression. Every day, I take 5 prescriptions for metabolic and mood disorders. Every night, I sleep with the assistance of a CPAP device.

If that sounds familiar, [it should](http://communicable.me/eat-food.html). Last
June, my wife and I set out to improve our health. I dieted and exercised for about two  months. In that time I lost nearly 30 pounds. But, ultimately, I let a setback push me off track, and I never got back on.

Now, I'm trying a different program. It's called [Take Shape for Life](http://www.tsfl.com). It uses prepackaged meal replacements from [Medifast](http://www.medifast1.com). And, it involves a game called [The Meltdown Challenge](http://www.meltdownchallenge.com).

I'm supposed to eat six times a day: five meal replacements, and one "lean and green" meal. I'm supposed to drink 100 ounces of water a day. And, I'm supposed to check in with a health coach at least weekly.

Frankly, I was pretty skeptical. The diet works out to less than 1,000 calories a day, which is [well below the recommended minimum caloric intake for men](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/eat/calories.htm). No wonder they tell you not to start exercising at first. You're not eating enough calories to have any to spend on working out.

So, I'm a couple of weeks in and I have some observations:
* My health coach is an amazingly positive person.
* The game is a fun way of getting sucked into staying on track.
* The meal replacements mostly suck.
* I'm not nearly as hungry as I thought I would be.
* I'm surprised at how easy it is to drink 100+ ounces of water a day.

Progress so far: 12 pounds down. Check back in a while to see if I was able to maintain such a low calorie diet.
