Well, it's been one month since my wife and I began the 20/20 Lifestyles diet. Thankfully, I'm better at following the meal plan than I am at blogging about it! So far, I've lost 20.2 pounds!

For those of you keeping score, I lost a little over 10 pounds in week one. Then I lost another 9+ pounds over the next three weeks. This is completely normal. Most of the weight I lost in week one was water weight, because I was woefully dehydrated. Once I started drinking enough water, my body dumped the excess reserves. From here on out though, I hope to maintain a pace of 2-3 pounds per week.

With July successfully in the books, here are my goals for August:

1. Lose another 10 pounds
2. Exercise 30+ minutes, 3+ times a week

As always, wish me luck!
