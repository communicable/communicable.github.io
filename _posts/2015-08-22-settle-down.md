August is nearly gone. So, how am I doing on my goals of losing 10 pounds and exercising for 30 minutes, 3+ times a week. Well...

I started August at 264.8 pounds. Now I'm at 258.6 pounds. So, that's 6.2 pounds in 3 weeks. With one week to go, it's unlikely that I'll hit 10 pounds for the month. But, 8 pounds (or 2 pounds a week) could still happen.

As for the exercise? I haven't been doing any. :( I haven't even been paying attention to my fancy fitness tracker when it tells me to get up and move. So, that likely explains why I'm not going to hit 10 pounds this month.

Tomorrow is a new day!
